{"name":"Broker garbage","body":"## About\r\nBroker_Garbage is a WoW add-on trying to manage that mess in your bags. Not enough information? Read on below!\r\n\r\nHave you ever been in a situation where you just can't turn in a quest because your inventory is full? Trying to figure out an item to delete that's cheap and won't make you loose much gold? This is one of the many situations where Broker_Garbage makes your life easier.\r\n\r\n### What it does\r\n\r\nBroker_Garbage shows your cheapest item(s) for easily freeing bag space. It uses your auction addon of choice for pricing, including disenchant prices if available. If you don't want to throw away that precious [Broken I.W.I.N. Button], put it on your Keep List and Broker_Garbage will keep it. Forever. Really! And those [Shiny Fish Scales]? Just put them on your Junk List.\r\n\r\n### Broker? As in buying apartments?\r\n\r\nThis addon is a LibDataBroker plugin and as such requires a display addon to work properly (i.e. to show funky tooltips).\r\nSome are [Bagnon](http://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/fileinfo.php?id=4459), [DockingStation](http://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/info11831-DockingStationDisplay.html), (very minimalistic) [NinjaPanel](http://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/info11884-NinjaPanel.html) or [Bazooka](http://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/info14767-Bazooka.html).\r\n\r\n## Features\r\n\r\nYou can disable almost all of these in the options panel.

I'll get notified of any posts there immediately and updates to fix your problem will find their way there first as well!\r\nIn your bug report (or feature suggestion) include any information I could need. Such information could be:\r\n* A stack trace/lua error message\r\n* Which version are you using? Where did you get it?\r\n* Is it connected to an action, item, character class? If so, which?\r\n* What is happening - and what would you expect to happen, instead?\r\n\r\n### Further information, hints, etc\r\n\r\n**How to disable it (temporarily)** Hold down your chosen disable key (SHIFT by default). If you want to prevent looting or selling, hold it until the corresponding frame shows up!\r\n\r\n**Tooltip Shortcuts**\r\n* SHIFT + Click: Delete the item on that line\r\n* CTRL + Click: Add the item on that line to your Keep List\r\n* ALT + Click: Add the item on that line to your Vendor Price List\r\n\r\n**How to add item categories** Right-click on the blue \"+\" button on the options panel. Then choose your desired entry.\r\n\r\n**How to limit an item** This only works on your Junk List. Use your mouse wheel to increase/decrease the count, hold SHIFT while doing so to move 10 steps at a time\r\n\r\n**What of those question mark items** Those are items your client doesn't know yet. Hover them to update the display.\r\n\r\n**Anything else** Broker_Garbage uses the slash command /garbage (or /garb in short).\r\nFor more detailed information on how things work, have a look at the readme.txt files in the addon folders.","tagline":"WoW-Addon: Get that junk out of your bags","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
